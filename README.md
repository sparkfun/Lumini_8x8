[*SparkFun LuMini LED matrix (COM-15047)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15047)

The LuMini 8x8 Matrix is a great way to add a square of light to just about anything, or even make a screen of a custom shape. The LuMini product line uses the same LED used on our Lumenati boards, the APA102, just in a smaller, 2.0x2.0 mm package. This allows for incredibly tight pixel densities, and thus, a screen with less pixelation.
